    "name": "mercury",
    "description": "Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury)",
    "descriptionInside": "Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. The planet's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3",
    "descriptionSurface": "Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. ",

    "name": "venus",
    "description": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight",
    "descriptionInside": "Without seismic data or knowledge of its moment of inertia, little direct information is available about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure.",
    "descriptionSurface": "Venus and Earth are near-twins in size, mass, composition, and (from their positions in the Solar System) conditions when they formed. Like Earth, Venus has a large iron core and rocky silicate mantle. Its crust is largely basalt (again, like Earth).",

  {
    "name": "earth",
    "description": "Third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, lakes, rivers, and other freshwater.",
    "descriptionInside": "Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle.",
    "descriptionSurface": "The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi). Of this, 70.8%, or 361.13 million km2 (139.43 million sq mi), is below sea level and covered by ocean water.",

    "name": "mars",
    "description": "Fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'.",
    "descriptionInside": "Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials.[68] Current models of its interior imply a core consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16–17% sulfur",
    "descriptionSurface": "Mars is a terrestrial planet whose surface consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The Martian surface is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt.",

    "name": "jupiter",
    "description": "Fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.",
    "descriptionInside": "Before the early 21st century, most scientists expected Jupiter to either consist of a dense core, a surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen (with some helium) extending outward to about 80% of the radius of the planet.",
    "descriptionSurface": "As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either.",

    "description": "Sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.",
    "descriptionInside": "Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass.",
    "descriptionSurface": "Saturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a solid core.Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator.",

    "description": "Seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.",
    "descriptionInside": "Uranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27 g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn",
    "descriptionSurface": "Scientists report that between 80 percent and 85 percent of Uranus consist if an ice and rock mass. The ices are mostly frozen water, ammonia and methane around a liquid core.",

    "descriptionInside": "Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10 GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere.",
    "descriptionSurface": "Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. ",
